# Thesis Template
Basic layout of my thesis without any of the content of custom macros. You can just put your content in.

## Things to check when proof reading:
- Captions/bullet points end with a full stop.
- No dead references (highlight [?])
- No repeated words
- No overflowing lines/paragraphs
- Footnote markers should be after punctuation
- Check URLs have date accessed
- Check footnotes are all on the right page
- Check `\\emph` environments have punctuation inside
- Check figure references go to the right figure
